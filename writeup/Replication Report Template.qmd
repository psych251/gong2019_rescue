## Introduction

My research interests lie broadly in culture, emotion, and well-being, topics that may not appear to be directly related to this study at first glance. However, the complex interplay between age, donation behaviour, and various relational factors (i.e., kinship, social distance) described in the original paper intuitively appears to me to be shaped by culture. Culture moulds how we understand age, our attitudes towards donation, and -- perhaps most importantly here -- how we relate to our families and close others (vs our non-relatives and strangers). When I looked over the original paper, I was interested to see that the sample was composed of "community-dwelling Chinese adults" apparently living in Hong Kong and immediately wondered if possible cultural differences between the sample used in original study and the sample used in the first replication attempt may have been implicated in the failure to replicate. Indeed, the authors of the original paper suggest the possibility of culture influencing their results, writing that "future studies should test whether this age difference in kin-selection in prosocial behaviors varies across cultures". If possible within the constraints of this project, I would be interested in potentially controlling for cultural background in my replication attempt, but I am very interested in this project in any case.

To conduct this experiment, I will need to collect data from a sample of older and younger adults. I will need to create a survey containing the following demographic items: gender, age, core social network size (i.e., estimated number of important relatives/friends), level of education, and household income. Older participants will also be asked to complete the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) as a measure of cognitive function. All participants will be asked to complete a hypothetical donation task in they will be asked how much money or time they would donate to a number of targets who systematically vary in their closeness to and kinship with the participant. The study will use a mixed design in which age (older vs younger) is a between-subjects variable and donation form (money vs time), kinship with the target (relative vs non-relative), and social distance with the target (targets ranked 1st, 2nd, 5th, 10th, 20th, 50th, and 100th in a list of 100 people ranked in descending order of closeness) are within-subjects variables.

Analysis will involve first fitting a hyperbolic discount function to group data and testing for goodness of fit, then fitting a hyperbolic discount function to individual data to find each participant's discount rate (k) and area under curve (AUC) values. k and AUC values will then be log-transformed. Correlations between demographic variables and transformed k and AUC values will be investigated, and finally I will run a mixed 2 (age) × 2 (donation form) × 2 (kinship) repeated measures ANOVA on transformed k and AUC values.

A key challenge will be recruitment of a sample of older adults. The older adult sample in the original study were 60-84 years old and it may be difficult to recruit people in this age bracket through Prolific. It may be worthwhile considering a) not including the older adult sample, b) the benefits and pitfalls of recruiting a slightly younger older adult sample, c) whether it might be possible to include age as a continuous rather than categorical variable and changing the analysis strategy accordingly, or d) including age as a control variable rather than as an independent variable of primary interest. A personal challenge will be learning how to fit a function to data; this is something I've never done before but a skill I'm looking forward to developing.

## Summary of prior replication attempt

Based on the prior write-up, describe any differences between the original and 1st replication in terms of methods, sample, sample size, and analysis. Note any potential problems such as exclusion rates, noisy data, or issues with analysis. 

## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

How much power does your planned sample have for original effect? For an attenuated effect that is half the size of the original? 

(If power analysis is not possible or precise, discuss more fully how you determined a sample size that would be sufficient for rescue.)

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Controls

What attention checks, positive or negative controls, or other quality control measures are you adding so that a (positive or negative) result will be more interpretable?


### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study and 1st replication

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Results of control measures

How did people perform on any quality control checks or positive and negative controls? 

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Three-panel graph with original, 1st replication, and your replication is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

## Mini meta analysis
Combining across the original paper, 1st replication, and 2nd replication, what is the aggregate effect size? 

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
